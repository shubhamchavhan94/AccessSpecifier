----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignments share- Program with output-> 1 to 6- review programs.

- we can apply to variable, method and class
- used to restrict the access

- 4 types of access specifier-

private
default 
protected
public

private-

- apply to global variable, method, inner class.
- outer class cant be private
- local variable cant be private
- can access/call within class not outside of class or outside of package


default-

- apply to global variable, local variable, method, inner class
- apply to outer class.
- can access within same class or different class within same package only.
- no need to use keyword default like private
- when the access specifier is not mentioned then it will treat as default access specifier.


protected-

- apply to global variable, method, inner class
- cant apply to local variable and outer class
- can access within same class or different class or in the same package
  and different package but inheritance is applicable.(ignore it).


public-

- apply to global variable, method, inner class, outer class
- cant apply to local variable
- we can access within class or outside of class or same package or different package.


why we use access specifier ?
